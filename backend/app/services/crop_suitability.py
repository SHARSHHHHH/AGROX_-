"""Deterministic crop suitability engine for Madhya Pradesh.

Scores candidate crops against measured soil and weather values. Every score is
arithmetic over the reference table below — the LLM is never asked which crop to
grow, only to explain a ranking that was already computed here.

---------------------
The agronomic ranges below are representative values for MP conditions compiled
for this project. They are NOT a substitute for state agricultural university
recommendations. Before production use, have them reviewed against JNKVV

    Kharif  June-October     (monsoon sown)
