"""Biogas feasibility and estimation.

WHAT THIS IS, AND IS NOT
------------------------
This is an agricultural PLANNING aid. It answers "is a biogas plant worth
considering on my farm, and roughly what would it produce?" from figures the
farmer types in.

It is NOT an engineering design tool. It does not size pressure vessels, does
not specify construction, and does not certify anything. Digester geometry,
gas piping and structural work are qualified-professional territory, and every
output here says so.

WHY EVERY NUMBER IS A RANGE
---------------------------
Published gas yields for cattle dung vary by roughly a third depending on
breed, diet, dung freshness, ambient temperature and retention time. A farm in
Indore in January and the same farm in June will not perform alike.

Presenting a single figure like "2.4 m3/day" invites a farmer to treat it as a
specification and spend real money against it. So the engine carries a low and
a high figure throughout, and the API surfaces both.

NO LLM IS CALLED FROM THIS FILE
-------------------------------
Every value is arithmetic over published typical yields. The assistant may
later rephrase these results in the farmer's language; it cannot originate a
quantity, because it is never asked to.
